# naf_calc
Not another fuel calculator. An iRacing fuel calculator written in Rust.

very much a work in progress.

TODO:

 * need visual indication of which laps/time values are estimated vs the actual race settings.
 * for warmup/parade laps need to use race config time/laps rather than the current time/laps as those are
    for the parade laps, not the race.
 * car.left.laps should have one decimal place.
 * needs to actually set the pit stop options when getting on pit road.

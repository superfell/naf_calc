# naf_calc
Not another fuel calculator. An iRacing fuel calculator written in Rust.

very much a work in progress.

TODO:

 * for warmup/parade laps need to use race config time/laps rather than the current time/laps as those are
    for the parade laps, not the race.
 * strat calc should take the current fuel level, not use the one from the end of the last lap (this is needed
   for showing the post pit stop strat)
